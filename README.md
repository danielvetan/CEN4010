For windows user a `setup.bat` has been added which will create your virtual environment for you.

![](https://i.ibb.co/zHDRw8S/setup-gif.gif)

To ensure that everything runs smoothly, please download:

- The latest [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) version (windows)

**_Note: DB ISSUES_**

If you are experiencing issues with the `setup.bat` not loading correctly is because you might have not configured your database locally.
By Default the DB Config is set to

![](https://i.ibb.co/qRWQDW6/code1.png)

This will automatically use the Heroku DB.

## PLEASE USE YOUR LOCAL DB FOR TESTING!

### MAC

MAC setup file coming soon.
For now run it on the terminal üë®‚Äçüíª

- `cd CEN4010` Go inside project folder
- `python3 -m venv venv` Create your virtual environment
- `source ./venv/bin/activate/` Activate your virtual environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` Install dependencies
- `cd app` Go inside app folder
- `uvicorn main:app --reload` Run uvicorn server

When uvicorn is online, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` on your browser to use SwaggerUI

## Documentation

In here you will find briefly what the folder structure is for our project

![](https://i.ibb.co/5F7Z1Ck/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-2-08-05-PM.png)

### App folder

In the app folder you will find all the components that are needed for our restfulAPI
self explanatory.

### Config folder

In our config folder you will find all the settings needed for our resfulAPI such as

**FASTAPI SETTINGS**

- `PROJECT_TITLE: str = 'Bookstore RestAPI'` Our restfulAPI title for FASTAPI
- `PROJECT_VERSION: str = '0.1.0'` Our version of our API

**DB SETTINGS**

**_CHANGE IF YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD YOU ARE DOING_**

- `POSTGRES_LOCAL: bool = True` `True` if you want to use local, `False` for Heroku
- `POSTGRES_USER: str` postgres user most likely your machine name, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: str` If you set a local password put it here, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_SERVER: str` Server you created locally, Heroku is set already
- `POSTGRES_PORT: str = '5432'` Defaul port dont change
- `POSTGRES_DB: str` Databse you created locally, Heroku is set already

### DB folder

In our DB folder you will find our **database.py** and **models.py**

Do not touch **database.py** (skipping)

In **models.py**

Here you will introduce a new model that is going to be sent over to the database. This is going
to create a table based on the model.

If you need to recreate another model for the database copy the `User` model already created and
modify it to your needs. For extra help use [sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/tutorial.html#create-a-schema) docs

### Schemas folder

In the schemas folder you will find all the schemas that are used in FastAPI that are then
translated to the models in our db folder.

### Main.py

This is the brains of our backend restfulAPI here you will be adding your API endpoints.

**_future structuring of the routers will be coming soon, to seperate everyones api call_**
